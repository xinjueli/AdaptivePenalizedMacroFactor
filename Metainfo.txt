Name of Quantlet:  Adaptive Penalized MacroFactor

Published in:     'Unpublished; Theoretical description 
of why we are going to use the                    adaptive methods'

Description:      'Builds a classification model to predict
by combining the shrinking                    methods with the adaptive methods.
The model can automatically detect                    the homogenous interval 
and the active macro-factor set'

Keywords:         'regression, penalization,classification,
 simulation, random-forest, plot,              graphical representation'
