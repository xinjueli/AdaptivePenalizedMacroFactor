Published in:     'Unpublished; Theoretical description 
                   of why we are going to use the adaptive methods'

Description:      'Builds a classification model to predict
                   by combining the shrinking methods with the adaptive methods.
                   model can automatically detect the homogenous interval 
                   and the active macro-factor set'
